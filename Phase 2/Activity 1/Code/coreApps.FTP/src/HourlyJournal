1. should I create one or two aspects?
2.No send receive message in Channels so I have to think of other ways to find pointcuts
3. In order to change the version numbers, I need to find a method where the message is created before sending
	Possible candidates: Encoder.encode , sc.write
	
	Client is Sending a FTResquest version 1.0 but Server is expecting FTRequest version 0.0
	
	I have to get the contents from the existing message and create a 
	whole new message with the same contents bt a different type and version number.

Removing ACK messages
---------------------------
1. Find a way to remove ACK messages(use isComplete() method of message to achieve this)
At server side look for remainingBytes==0 (when  FileTransferResponse with iscomplete==true
 is sent) to close connection
At Client side look for _fileTransferResponse.isComplete()==true to close connection

2. At server side change isFinnished to class memeber variable and check for its trueness. and set transferComplete = true.
3. At Client side check if transferComplete==true the open file and close connection

New Version control
----------------------------
1. We must change the Messages to include sender version and receiver version attributes
2. By introducing sender and receiver version numbers in messages we can get rid of the previous assumption of client expecting version 1 and server expecting ver 0 messages only.
3. Put the new sender and receiver version numbers in the Message class so that all subclasses have access to these attributes.
4. Modify the Message class to put in new sender and receiver version numbers. alter the gettters and stters accordingly.


5. Remove setting version from message constructor and set it when after creating the message as a method call

6. Change the send aspects to remove the assumptions of client and server dealing with a particular version number and get that info from the messages themselves.

7. Introduce version number attribute for client and serve---(bad idea introduces coupling)

8. if sender -receiver version number is same no need to change message version
